# Requirements
Data analysis was performed with R on a private HPC (Linux) but could be performed locally given sufficient memory. Please note that some parts of the scRNAseq analysis may temporarily require **>200GB** of free memory. All packages used in the analysis (all freely available from CRAN or the respective developer repository) are listed below.

- R 4.2.0
- survival 3.3-1
- survminer 0.4.9
- gridExtra 2.3
- svMisc 1.2.3
- stringr 1.5.1
- ggplot2 3.5.1
- rstatix 0.7.0
- ggpubr 0.4.0

# Figure S1M and S2X
See the individual R notebooks for [Figure S1M](Figure%20S1M.Rmd) and [Figure S2X](Figure%20S2X.Rmd).
